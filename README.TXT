PROJECT TITLE: opmi-ziuq-elbiss
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
Create a game on an (8x8? 9x9?) 2d array where you can type w, a, s, or d to move, and when next to a square, type e to interact with whatever object is nearby. If two objects are nearby, type 1 or 2 to choose which one to interact with.
Interacting with people might get you money, or you might have to play a mini game.
There will probably be a treasure locked by a gate somewhere, and you have to find the key.
